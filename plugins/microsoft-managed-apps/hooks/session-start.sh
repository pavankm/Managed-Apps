# SessionStart hook: inform the agent that the Microsoft Managed Apps plugin
# automatically attributes every `ms` CLI invocation via MS_CLI_ORIGIN.
# The PreToolUse hook (pre-tool-use.sh) enforces this transparently — this
# message just makes the behavior visible to the agent so it isn't surprised
# when the executed command differs from what it requested.

export MSG="[Microsoft/managed-apps] CLI attribution is enforced automatically: every shell command that invokes 'ms' (the @microsoft/managed-apps-cli binary) is rewritten by a PreToolUse hook to set MS_CLI_ORIGIN=plugin/<host-agent> (e.g. plugin/claude-code, plugin/copilot-cli, or plugin/unknown). You do not need to export this variable yourself - the hook handles it on every tool call. If a user has already set MS_CLI_ORIGIN to a different value, the hook leaves their value alone."

# Read hook stdin with a bounded single-line `read -t` (payloads are
# single-line JSON) so the hook fails open quickly instead of blocking session
# startup if the host engine doesn't promptly send a newline / close stdin.
# The captured value is passed to Python via env (HOOK_INPUT) so Python never
# blocks on stdin itself.
